Suggestions to Improve Your Prediction
Here are several practical and model-focused improvements you can apply:

ðŸ”§ 1. Include More Predictive Features
The model may lack signal richness. You can:

Add technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands

Add volume-related features

Include Fear Index delta (change from previous day)

Include day-of-week or month (for cyclic patterns)

python
Copy
Edit
df["fear_change"] = df["fear_index"].diff().shift(1)
ðŸ”§ 2. Improve Lag Handling
Your current prediction might be reacting late due to sequence lag. Try:

Shifting targets further ahead: e.g., predict price[t+3] instead of price[t+1]

Include past price deltas as input:

python
Copy
Edit
df["price_return"] = df["price"].pct_change().shift(1)
ðŸ”§ 3. Add Dropout or Layer Normalization
Your LSTM might be overfitting or underfitting. Try:

Adding dropout in your LSTM layers

Adding LayerNorm after the LSTM output

ðŸ”§ 4. Use Multistep Training
Currently, you predict one step ahead. Consider predicting multiple steps (t+1, t+2, t+3) with a decoder or stacked LSTM â€” more realistic for financial forecasting.

ðŸ”§ 5. Improve Label Scaling
If your Close price is scaled improperly (e.g., across all time), the model may not adapt to local volatility. Use:

MinMaxScaler over sliding windows, or

Predict returns instead of raw price:

python
Copy
Edit
df["log_return"] = np.log(df["Close"] / df["Close"].shift(1))
Then recover price as:

python
Copy
Edit
pred_price = prev_price * np.exp(pred_return)
ðŸ”§ 6. Hybrid Loss Tuning
Try adjusting the direction penalty strength:

python
Copy
Edit
total_loss = mse + 0.1 * dir_loss  # instead of 0.3
Too much penalty may prevent the model from matching magnitude.

ðŸ“Š 7. Visualize Direction Accuracy
You're plotting price error, which is good. But also consider:

python
Copy
Edit
correct_direction = np.sign(pred - prev_price) == np.sign(true - prev_price)
accuracy = np.mean(correct_direction)
This helps evaluate whether the model gets the direction right, which may still be valuable for trading decisions even if the price value is off.

âœ… TL;DR â€” What You Can Try Right Now
Add fear_change, price_return, or volume as new features.

Predict log returns instead of raw prices.

Add dropout and test different hidden_dim sizes.

Reduce the direction penalty (0.3 â†’ 0.1) and monitor impact.

Visualize directional accuracy, not just RMSE.

If you'd like, I can modify your script to:

Add return-based targets

Include new features like RSI or fear change

Implement multistep prediction
